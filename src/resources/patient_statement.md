   **Dementia and related NCDs Risk (DemNCDrisk) Assessment**

# 2. **What is the research study about?**  
   You are invited to take part in this research study. The research study aims to collect data on risk factors for dementia and related non-communicable diseases (NCDs) including stroke, diabetes and myocardial infarction (MI) (or heart attack), in adults aged 18 years and older. This questionnaire includes items on your age, sex, education level, your lifestyle habits and health factors. It uses information obtained from published studies to assign risk scores to the responses to the questionnaire. On completion of the questionnaire, you will be advised which health and lifestyle factors may pose a risk for developing dementia, stroke, diabetes, and heart attack, followed by expert advice and recommendations. It is also hoped that the knowledge you gain from completing this questionnaire will increase your awareness of probable risk factors.

   The data collected from this research will help researchers understand the risk factors present in the wider Australian population to inform health policy and programs to reduce the burden of chronic disease.

# 3. **Who is conducting this research?**  
   The study is being carried out by the following researchers:
   - **Prof. Kaarin Anstey**  
   - **Dr Ruth Peters**  
   - **Dr Md Hamidul Huque**  
   - **Dr Kim Kiely**  
   - **Ms Meiwei Li**  

   All are from UNSW and Neuroscience Research Australia (NeuRA).  
   **Research Funder:** National Health and Medical Research Council.

# 4. **Inclusion / Exclusion Criteria**  
   Before you decide to participate in this research study, we need to ensure that it is ok for you to take part. The research study is looking to recruit people who meet the following criteria:
   - **Inclusion:**  
     - Adults aged 18 years and older.  
     - Have access to internet services and have a computer, mobile device, or tablet.

# 5. **Do I have to take part in this research study?**  
   Participation in any research study is voluntary. If you do not want to take part, you do not have to.  
   If you decide you want to take part in the research study, you will be asked to:
   1. Read the information carefully (and ask questions if necessary).  
   2. Complete the online questionnaire.

# 6. **What does participation in this research require, and are there any risks involved?**  
   If you decide to take part in the research study, we will ask you to complete an online questionnaire. The questionnaire will collect data on your age, sex, health, lifestyle, and other related questions to provide information on your risk of future dementia, stroke, diabetes, and heart attack. It should take approximately **20 to 30 minutes** to complete.

   There are no expected risks to you in completing this questionnaire; however, if you feel discomfort or change your mind during the questionnaire, you can stop participating at any time. You can also tell a member of the research team and they will provide you with assistance.

   If you are concerned about the risk profile and recommendations provided to you after the questionnaire, you are encouraged to discuss it with a qualified health care provider such as your GP.

# 7. **What are the possible benefits to participation?**  
   - You will receive personalised risk profiles and detailed recommendations based on your questionnaire responses.  
   - The research will help us understand risk factors in the wider Australian population to inform health policy and programs aimed at reducing the burden of chronic disease.  
   - By managing modifiable risk factors and maintaining a healthy lifestyle, you may reduce your own risk of developing dementia and related NCDs.

# 8. **What will happen to information about me?**  
   - Submission of the online questionnaire indicates your consent. By clicking the **“I agree to participate”** button, you are providing permission for the research team to collect and use information about you for the research study.  
   - The research team will store your de-identified data for a minimum of **7 years** after completion of the research.  
   - Data storage:  
     - De-identified format (responses coded and stored separately from your email).  
     - Secure UNSW Amazon Web Server with multi-factor authentication.  
     - Login details and survey data stored separately; linkage only possible by the research team.

   You will be asked to provide consent for the research team to share or use your de-identified information in future research that focuses on identifying prevalence of risk factors for chronic disease and evaluating interventions to promote healthy ageing. Your information will only be shared in a format that cannot identify you.

# 9. **How and when will I find out what the results of the research study are?**  
   The research team intends to publish and report the results of the study in a way that will not identify you. Findings using the DemNCDrisk tool will be reported on the publicly available DemNCDrisk website.

# 10. **What if I want to withdraw from the research study?**  
  If you consent and later change your mind, you may withdraw at any time by:
  - Completing the **Withdrawal of Consent Form** at the end of this document, or  
  - Contacting the research team directly.

  Upon withdrawal, any data you have provided will be destroyed and no further information collected. Your decision will not affect your relationship with UNSW Sydney or NeuRA.
